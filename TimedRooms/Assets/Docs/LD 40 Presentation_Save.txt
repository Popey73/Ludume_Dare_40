Hi, there is my first multiplayer game with Unity3D. So many time spent on the network and not on the game :( But it was very interesting and I learn a lot.

Let me know if the network work fine for you and if is not, launch the offline mode to try the game.

Don’t forget to use you shield with space.

Enjoy :)
